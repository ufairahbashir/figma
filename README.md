Hello, em.. its a little bit awkward he.he.he
<br> as you may see, I'm switching my interest into UI/UX (I dunno if my future self will be back to promgramming -because deep down I dreamt to be non-typo programmer [which is hard to do]-)
<br>
<br> I love to design [now] but i feel like I lost something in myself when Im swtiching to UI/UX
<br> Maybe, because i dont code anymore [somehow im glad and sad at the same time]
<br>
<br>
I dont upload my design here. I just make it to declare and as a reminder that Ive ever switched to UIUX when my future self see this readme. you can access my UIU design in here www.figma/@ufairahbashir I dont upload much [cause some projects are private] I upload it in my spare time.
